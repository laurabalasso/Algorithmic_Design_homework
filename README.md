# Algorithmic_Design_homework
This repository contains the homework for the course of Algorithmic design. 

Each forlder corresponds to a different assignment and contains:
* a README that presents the assignment's requirements
* the required implementations in C/C++ 
* tests on the implementations' correctness and execution time 
* a makefile to easily compile the code
* (possibly) a folder with the results
