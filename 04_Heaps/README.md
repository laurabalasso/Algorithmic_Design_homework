# Homework 4: Heaps

* Implement the array-based representation of a binary heap.

* Implement an iterative version of `HEAPIFY`.

* Test the implementation on a set of instances of the problem and evaluate the execution time.

### In this folder 
Both the max and the min heap are implemented in the file `src/heap.cpp`.
In `main.cpp`  the implemented function are tested on a max heap, then the execution time required to build a max heap from an array is measured for different array sizes.
Use the command `make` to compile the code. Then run the executable to get the results of the tests.
